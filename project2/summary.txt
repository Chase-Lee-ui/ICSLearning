Summary

	All requirements were met in that all functions and variables to be used in C++ have been used and
are fully functional. Functions that were originally in C have now been converted to C++ and run under
C++ standards. Additional functions like the reverse or overloading the << operator have been made and
are implemented in the program. I had gone through my old testplan.xlsx and then made some additional
test cases to be done in the C++ version of this program. I tested all of the old functions first to
make sure that they are implemented correctly and then I tested the new function which was the reverse
function. In addition, another test case that is not necessarily shown is
the different constructors, if a filename is put in while calling the llist
constructor it will read that file and store it.
	There are two additional features in this program that was not instructed
and that is the copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator, both of these
functions do the same thing in that it copies the records stored in one linked list
and puts it in a new linked list under new addresses.
	Some future enhancements would be to add a graphical interface so that it is much more
appealing to the eyes and easier to differentiate the records. Although we did not need to use both
llist constructors, there could've been an option for the user to open a specific file that they want
for their linked list.

	The test cases that have passed are the ones that are highlighted in green in excel. This 
shows that all the test cases have passed which means the program should work properly when any 
user uses it. I believe that all cases in which there might be a problem, glitch or incorrect 
input have been tested.
	Some problems that I have faced was that the delete record was not working so after some
fixing I got it to work the way I wanted it too but it had meant that I had to rerun the cases that
used the delete record function. I also fixed some minor user interface problems that appeared as I
was testing the test cases. Most of them did not affect the outcomes of the test cases.
